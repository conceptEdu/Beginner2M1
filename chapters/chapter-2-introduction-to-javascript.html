<h1>Chapter 2: Introduction to JavaScript</h1>

<h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is a high-level programming language mainly used for web
development. It is used to create interactive web applications and
supports both client-side and server-side development.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript works with HTML and CSS and integrates easily with
standard libraries. It plays a major role in modern web applications.
</p>

<h2>JavaScript and DOM</h2>
<p>
JavaScript can interact with the DOM (Document Object Model).
Using DOM, JavaScript can modify the structure, style, and content
of web pages dynamically.
</p>

<p>
With the help of Node.js, JavaScript can also run outside the browser,
allowing server-side execution.
</p>

<h2>Key Characteristics of JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Single-threaded language (executes one task at a time)</li>
  <li>Interpreted language (executes line by line)</li>
  <li>Dynamically typed (data type decided at runtime)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features of JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Client-side scripting:</strong>
    JavaScript runs in the browser and provides fast response time
    without communicating with the server every time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Event-driven:</strong>
    JavaScript responds to user actions like clicks, keypress,
    and mouse events.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Asynchronous:</strong>
    JavaScript can handle tasks like fetching data from servers
    without blocking the execution.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Client-Side Nature of JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Involves controlling the browser and its DOM</li>
  <li>Handles user events like clicks and form inputs</li>
  <li>Popular client-side libraries include React, Angular, and Vue</li>
</ul>

<h2>Server-Side Nature of JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Interacts with databases</li>
  <li>Handles file manipulation</li>
  <li>Generates server responses</li>
  <li>Node.js and Express.js are commonly used for server-side JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<h2>Applications of JavaScript</h2>

<h3>1. Web Development</h3>
<p>
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.
Frameworks like React and Angular enhance frontend development.
</p>

<h3>2. Server Applications</h3>
<p>
Using Node.js, JavaScript is used to build powerful backend
applications and full-stack solutions.
</p>

<h3>3. Game Development</h3>
<p>
JavaScript combined with HTML5 and libraries like Phaser or Three.js
is used to create interactive web-based games.
